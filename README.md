In this project, I designed an HTML page.
The user enters values into the corresponding TextBoxes that appear in the table.
When the user clicks the "Show Distribution" button, using JavaScript, I display a row (Div divided into 6 pieces) across the entire width of the page,
divided into colors corresponding to each singer according to the ratio of each singer's score to the total number of scores.
I implemented a design on the images using the opacity property, so that when the mouse is over the image the value will be 1, otherwise the value will be 0.5.
In addition, clicking on the image opens a new window that displays a details page about the singer.
